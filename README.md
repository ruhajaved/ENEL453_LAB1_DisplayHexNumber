## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Insert a multiplexer into the reference project to allow the HEX outputs to display either Hexadecimal or Decimal values (currently the design on displays the decimal value). The Multiplexer must be controlled by a slide switch and you must decide which one to use. You must provide a testbench for Multiplexer.

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1.	To give the team an opportunity to become familiar with the technologies used

## Technologies
